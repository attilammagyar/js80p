System Requirements
-------------------

 * Operating System: Windows 7 or newer, or Linux (e.g. Ubuntu 20.04 or newer)
 * CPU: 32 or 64 bit, SSE2 support
 * RAM: 50-200 MB, depending on buffer size

On Linux, the `libxcb`, `libxcb-render`, and `libcairo` libraries, and either
the `kdialog` or the `zenity` application are required to run JS80P. To install
them on Debian based distributions (e.g. Ubuntu), you can use the following
command:

    sudo apt-get install libxcb1 libxcb-render0 libcairo2 zenity kdialog

Tested with [REAPER](https://www.reaper.fm/) 6.78.

<a name="install"></a>

Installation
------------

1. [Download a plugin archive for your platform](https://attilammagyar.github.io/js80p/).
2. Extract the ZIP archive.
3. Depending on which plugin type you downloaded, copy `js80p.dll` on Windows,
   `js80p.so` on Linux to the folder where you keep your VST 2.4 plugins,
   or copy `js80p.vst3` (on both Windows and Linux) to your VST 3 folder.

The `presets` folder in the archive contains a few sounds that you can load by
clicking the _Import Patch_ icon near the top left corner of the main screen of
the plugin.

Frequenctly Asked Questions
---------------------------

<a name="faq-which"></a>

### Which distribution should I download?

Due to how MIDI works in VST 3 plugins, the recommended distribution for most
people is the 64-bit FST plugin which can be loaded into any 64-bit DAW which
supports VST 2.4.

If your DAW does not support VST 2.4 however, then you will need the 64-bit
VST 3 plugin.

The 32-bit versions are only needed by those who deliberately use a 32-bit DAW,
e.g. because they want to keep using some really old plugins which are not
available for 64-bit systems.

If you are in doubt, then try the 64 bit FST version, and if your DAW doesn't
recognize it, then try the 64 bit VST 3 version, then the 32 bit FST version,
etc.

Note that all versions use the same high-precision sound synthesis engine
internally, so the CPU architecture does not affect the sound quality.

### Aren't Phase Modulation and Frequency Modulation equivalent? Why have both?

The reason for JS80P having both kinds of modulation is that they are not
always equivalent. They are only identical when the modulator signal is a
sinusoid, but with each added harmonic, PM and FM start to differ more and
more. A detailed mathematical explanation of this is shown in
[pm-fm-equivalence.md](pm-fm-equivalence.md).

### Where does the name come from?

In 2022, I started developing a browser-based synthesizer using the [Web Audio
API][webaudio], mostly being inspired by the [Yamaha CS-80][cs80]. I named that
project [JS-80][js80]. Then I started adding one little feature and
customization option after the other, then it got out of hand, and I also
started finding limitations of doing audio in the browser. So I decided to
implement a cleaned up version of this synth in C++ as a DAW plugin (with a
better waveshaper antialiasing method than what's available in the browser),
and so JS80P was born.

<a name="dev-dep"></a>

### Dependencies

The `lib/` directory contains code from the following projects:

 * [FST](https://git.iem.at/zmoelnig/FST)
 * [VST3 SDK](https://github.com/steinbergmedia/vst3sdk)

#### Linux

To compile JS80P on e.g. Ubuntu Linux 20.04 for all supported platforms, the
following packages need to be installed:

    apt-get install \
        binutils \
        build-essential \
        g++ \
        gcc-multilib \
        g++-multilib \
        libcairo2-dev \
        libcairo2-dev:i386 \
        libx11-dev \
        libx11-dev:i386 \
        libxcb1-dev \
        libxcb1-dev:i386 \
        libxcb-render0-dev \
        libxcb-render0-dev:i386 \
        mingw-w64

<a name="dev-compile"></a>

### Compiling

#### Windows

Assuming that you have installed MinGW-w64 to `C:\mingw64`, you can use the
following commands to run tests and compile JS80P for Windows:

    SET PATH=C:\mingw64\bin;%PATH%
    SET TARGET_PLATFORM=x86_64-w64-mingw32
    SET DEV_OS=windows

    mingw32-make.exe check
    mingw32-make.exe all

#### Linux

Run `make check` for running tests.

The following commands (on a 64 bit Linux environment) will compile JS80P for
64 bit Windows, 32 bit Windows, 64 bit Linux, and 32 bit Linux respectively:

    TARGET_PLATFORM=x86_64-w64-mingw32 make all
    TARGET_PLATFORM=i686-w64-mingw32 make all
    TARGET_PLATFORM=x86_64-gpp make all
    TARGET_PLATFORM=i686-gpp make all
