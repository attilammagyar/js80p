 *        Reducing the Aliasing of Nonlinear Waveshaping Using Continuous-Time Convolution
 *        (Parker, J., Zavalishin, V., & Bivic, E.L. - 2016)</a>. The shaping
 *        function is an approximation of a triangle wave which has a wavelength
 *        of 4.0, and which is positioned so that f(0.0) = 0.0, and the
 *        projection of the [-1.0, 1.0] interval is approximately itself.

        The table contains a whole period of the triangle wave function's
        antiderivative for the [-2.0, 2.0] interval. Folding occurs because the
        input (which is supposed to go from -1.0 to 1.0) is scaled up by
        1 + folding_level, so when the periodic-triangle-wave shaping function
        is applied, the scaled up input spans multiple wave periods.

        The triangle wave is aligned so that it projects the [-1.0, 1.0]
        interval onto itself. Since the wave is bandlimited, this projection is
        imperfect, so the first 10% of the folding level parameter is used for
        smoothly transitioning from the "bypass" state to the "no folding yet
        but the triangle wave already has some small influence" state.
